disorganized 35-cell structure into a professional 15-cell document with 
10 organized sections. All original content has been preserved, enhanced, 
and presented in a clear, logical manner suitable for immediate use and 
stakeholder presentation.

The notebook is now PRODUCTION-READY and can be used to build the 
PowerBI dashboard immediately following the included build instructions.

Estimated Total Project Time: ~3.5 hours
├─ Reading & Understanding: 60 minutes
├─ Building Dashboard: 120 minutes
├─ Testing & Refinement: 30 minutes
└─ Deployment: 10 minutes

RECOMMENDATION: Begin with CELL 1 (Project Overview) for quick orientation,
then follow CELL 11 (Build Instructions) to create the dashboard.
